# StayEase – Airbnb Clone Project

## 📌 Project Overview

StayEase is a full-stack accommodation booking web application inspired by Airbnb. Built as part of the **ALX Software Engineering Program** — combining both **ProDev Front-End** and **ProDev Back-End** tracks — this project simulates a real-world software development experience.

It allows users to browse and filter property listings, view detailed information, and complete bookings with a clean and responsive UI. The focus is on scalable architecture, strong teamwork, and practical application of advanced front-end and back-end technologies.
