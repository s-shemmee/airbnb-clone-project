  <h6>Well hello there, fellow coder! If you're seeing this in the raw markdown,</h6>

  <h6>you're either a curious dev... or an ALX student considering a *very* quick shortcut. ;)</h6>

  <h6>Let's be clear:</h6>

  <h6>This repo is like my unique fingerprint ‚Äì crafted with blood, sweat, and way too many debugging sessions.</h6>

  <h6>While I'm flattered you find it useful, originality is key in this program (and life!).</h6>

  <h6>So, feel free to be inspired, learn, and adapt.</h6>

  <h6>But if your repo suddenly looks *exactly* like mine,</h6>

  <h6>my "ownership radar" (and the ALX team's) might just go off. Just sayin' :)</h6>

  <h6>Save yourself the potential headache. Happy coding (and original thinking) <3! </h6>
